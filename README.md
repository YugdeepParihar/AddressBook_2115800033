UC 2: Implement Address Book API Controller
Define RESTful Endpoints: 
GET /api/addressbook → Fetch all contacts
GET /api/addressbook/{id} → Get contact by ID
POST /api/addressbook → Add a new contact
PUT /api/addressbook/{id} → Update contact
DELETE /api/addressbook/{id} → Delete contact
Use ActionResult<T> to return JSON responses
Test using Postman or CURL
